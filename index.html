   	<h2>about the movie</h2>
    <p>The film follows a troubled security guard as he begins working at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. While spending his first night on the job, he realizes the night shift at Freddy's won't be so easy to make it through. In another version of the movie, a young man takes a job at an infamous, long-abandoned pizzeria with a dark past, bringing his little sister along. As they uncover the restless spirits and vengeful animatronics within, they must confront their own haunting memories.</p>
    
  	<h2>Ratings:</h2>
    <p>The Five Nights at Freddy's movie has received negative reviews from critics, with a current rating of 26% on Rotten Tomatoes.
     The film's PG-13 rating limits its scariness and creates a toothless experience that fails to capture the creepiness of the video game series.
    The movie is too long at almost two hours, dragging down the horror-filled storyline and causing critics to lose interest. </p>
